## How to Play
1. The game will highlight a tile in the 3x3 grid. At the same time, a ton will be played aloud.
2. You need to track both the tiles and the tones. For each new turn, you need to decide if it matches the stimulus from N steps ago.
    - It's a match if the tone is the same as it was N steps ago.
    - It's a match if the tile is highlighted in the same position as it was N steps ago.
3. For tone matches press 'e' and for tile matches press 'i'.
4. Based on how you progress, the game will either increase or decrease the N value.
